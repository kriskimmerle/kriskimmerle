# Hey, I'm Kris 👋

I'm obsessed with the messy, practical side of AI governance: the gap between frameworks on paper and systems that actually work. I build tools here to explore that space.

### What I'm Building

I create tools to scratch my own itches around AI security, governance workflows, and developer productivity. Most are Python, most are experiments, some become useful.

```python
while coffee_available:
    idea = observe_governance_gap()
    repo = build_quick_tool(idea)
    if repo.works_for_others():
        share(repo)
```

I write about what I'm learning as I build RealPage's AI governance program in public. If you're figuring out AI governance at your org, I'm always happy to compare notes.
